    <h1>Apple Pie</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An apple pie is a fruit pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples. 
        Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, ice cream, custard or cheddar cheese. 
        It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; 
        the upper crust may be solid or latticed.</p>
    <p>Mock apple pie is a dessert made to taste like an apple pie with no apples required! 
        That's because the secret ingredients lie in the filling: crackers! Traditionally, 
        mock apple pie is made with a filling of soda crackers, lemon juice, sugar, a few pats of butter, and cinnamon.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie
        <li>Â¾ cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>6 cups thinly sliced apples</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Line a 9-inch pie dish with one pastry crust; set second one aside.</li>
        <li>Combine 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add more sugar if your apples are tart.</li>
        <li>Layer apple slices in the prepared pie dish, sprinkling each layer with cinnamon-sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Dot top layer with small pieces of butter. Cover with top crust.</li>
        <li>Bake pie on the lowest rack of the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until golden brown and filling bubbles, 30 to 35 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or cold.</li>
    </ol>
