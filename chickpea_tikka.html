    <h1>Chickpea Tikka Masala Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./images/chickpea_tikka_masala.jpg" alt="Image of CHickpea Tikka Masala in a Rice Bowl">
    <p>The story claims the dish was actually created in Glasgow by a Pakistani chef working at an Indian restaurant. 
        A British man ordered tikka masala and was very disappointed to see plain dry chicken, that wasn't his idea of Indian food. 
        The chef, to make him happy, quickly put together a sauce using tomatoes and garam masala spices. 
        Right there and then, the famous Chicken Tikka Masala was born.</p>
    <p>I believe this recipe is so popular worldwide because it uses the right amount and the right combination of Indian spices. 
        Many dishes can be too overpowering or too spicy for other cultures. 
        But tikka masala is quite mild and super flavourful at the same time.</p>
